## Simple Interest

The ammount paid on the pricipal only. Applies to loans with short terms (usually fraction of a year.

P = principal ($)
r = anuual rate (%)
t = term (years)
I = total interest ($)
S = sum of principal & interest ($)

I = Prt
S = P + I = P + Prt = P(I + rt)
p = S / (I + rt)

## Compound Interest

annual compound interest = interest is paid/added to the principal once per year otherwise converted at other regular periods, number of times it's converted p/a = frequency_of_conversion
